Diff-in-Diff with same balancing authorities but in different states. 
Can we see when they instituted a renewable energy policy.


Renewable portfolio standards

-some variables in 2014 dataset that I would like to use:
	-uprate completed
	-balancing area

-like to put together a new dataset

concern - there appear to more uprates in the new data 2014


Questions:
	-Is every year variable that shows planned uprate included in the regression

Looks like I want to use nplate to see if they actually did upgrade the plant

Upgrading of technology - as a byproduct increase capacity
-scap seems to 

Are these environmental additions
sfg: solid fuel gasifications
fbed: flued bed technology
pulcoal: 

Trade-off between higher capacity/efficiency and environmental effectiveness. 

Search term: Global Warming


1.)One idea - use google searches/twitter with keywords "climate" etc to signify uncertainty about regulation - see if that has an affect on coal power plants and upgrades - especially decision to expand or shut-down (see note 3). 
-could be a type of poisson regression (events per time period)  

2.) What about local factors and political uncertainty: can we look at swing counties and see how elections that swung one direction or the other (republican or democrat) and how that affected power plant investments, upgrades, etc. 

3.) Survival model of plant shutdowns - and various risk factors in place for this. (Sort of like my wind turbine study.) Also possible to expand this to re-starts (any of these).

4.)Combination of 2 and 3 - look at neighboring states/counties with power plants near border and in same electricity market (pjm?) but with different state regulations. Could do diff-in-diff type identification strategy. 

5.)"Beyond Coal" campaign - Sierra Club, Bloomberg, and Natural Gas producers. Adds uncertainty. Are they active in some states
