From EIA form 860 
1990 - 2013
http://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia860/

From the 1994 Annual Energy Outlook document, produced by EIA.
 
“Life extension is achieved by maintaining or improving the operating status of an electric power plant within acceptable levels of availability and efficiency, beyond the originally anticipated retirement date.”
 
“Repowering is achieved by investments made in a plant to substantially increase the plant's generating capability, to change generating fuels, or to install a more efficient generating technology at the plant site.”

questions?

OP	Operating - in service (commercial operation) and producing some electricity. Includes peaking units that are run on an as needed (intermittent or seasonal) basis.
SB	Standby/Backup - available for service but not normally used (has little or no generation during the year) for this reporting period.
OS	Out of service – was not used for some or all of the reporting period and is NOT expected to be returned to service in the next calendar year.
OA	Out of service – was not used for some or all of the reporting period but is expected to be returned to service in the next calendar year.
RE	Retired - no longer in service and not expected to be returned to service.

The data items of interest are in columns AW-BD in the spreadsheet.
 
puscap – planned uprate summer capacity
puwcap – planned uprate winter capacity
pumn   - planned uprate month
puyr   - planned uprate year
 
pdscap – planned derate summer capacity
pdwcap – planned derate winter capacity
pdmn   - planned derate month
pdyr   - planned derate year
 
Notice that, of a total of approximately 454 thousand records, only a couple thousand have data for uprates.  Only 500ish have planned derates.
