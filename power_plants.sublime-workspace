What about local factors and political uncertainty: can we look at swing counties and see how elections that swung one direction or the other (republican or democrat) and how that affected power plant investments, upgrades, etc. \n\n3.) Survival model of plant shutdowns - and various risk factors in place for this. (Sort of like my wind turbine study.) Also possible to expand this to re-starts (any of these).\n\n4.)Combination of 2 and 3 - look at neighboring states/counties with power plants near border and in same electricity market (pjm?) but with different state regulations. Could do diff-in-diff type identification strategy. \n\n5.)\"Beyond Coal\" campaign - Sierra Club, Bloomberg, and Natural Gas producers. Adds uncertainty. Are they active in some states\n\n",
